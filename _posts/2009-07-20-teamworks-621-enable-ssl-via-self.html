That part is not covered here.<br /><br /><b>-- UPDATE --</b><br /><br />After doing the above config for SSL, I keep getting an error in the author environment referring to an "SSLHandshakeException" when I open a service to make changes.  If I close that error dialog box, I can still edit the service, so I'm not sure if its a "critical" error or not.  I ended up editing the 99local.xml file, slowly changing all the urls back to HTTP until I found a combination that worked.  If you only change the &lt;client-link&gt; and the &lt;portal-prefix&gt; properties, that seems to do the trick ... he author environment seems to run without SSL Handshake errors and the portal site defaults to SSL, even for coaches.
