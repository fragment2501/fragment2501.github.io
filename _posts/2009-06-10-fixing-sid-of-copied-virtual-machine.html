I use VMWare virtuals for all the new servers I build at work, and the other day I ended up building a sandbox domain using copies of base windows 2003 virtual I'd built a few months ago.  With one domain controller in place, I joined another VM to the domain, which seemed to work just fine. After a reboot, I tried to login to the domain from the new server and got this error:<br /><br />"The name or security ID (SID) of the domain specified is inconsistent with<br />the trust information for that domain"<br /><br />After a bit of digging on google, I found that its an issue with one or more servers on the same domain using the same SID. Since both my servers in this case were copies of the same base windows 2003 server, I was running into exactly that issue. I was able to fix the problem by changing the SID of my new server using the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897418.aspx">NewSID</a> tool.
