I've finished the code behind the new Frederick Orchestra website.  You can  see the site before its release here: <a href="http://dev.frederickorchestra.org/">http://dev.frederickorchestra.org</a>.<br /><br />The site design is by <a href="http://www.jilliandeshazer.com">Jillian</a>.  Its all coldfusion with a small access database to make it simple and portable...the fewer dependancies the better. Check out the site and feel free send feedback.
