If youre just getting your feet wet with managing MOSS 2007, you'll find a lot of confusing information about the tools and features that ship with MOSS.  Doing a backup and restore seems as though it should be a simple matter of breaking out the SharePoint Designer 2007 tool and doing a site backup and restore from there. Wrong.  It turns out that SharePoint Designer 2007 is just a renamed and updated version of the Front Page product.  Much of the features for managing websites in Front Page work exactly the same in SharePoint Designer.  A website "backup" simply copies files, not the MOSS database content, web parts and other features you need to actually restore a SharePoint site.  To do a proper Site or Site Collection Backup/Restore, you need to use the command line tool that ships with MOSS 2007 on the server where MOSS is installed.  Perform these actions as the Administrative account on the box.<br /><br /><br />To do a site backup, run the following command from a dos prompt on the server:<br /><br /><div class="code"><br />c:>"%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\microsoft shared\web server extensions\12\bin\stsadm" -o backup -url http://mysite.com:1234 -filename mysite.com.backup<br /></div><br />to do a site restore from that backup:<br /><br /><div class="code"><br />c:>"%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\microsoft shared\web server extensions\12\bin\stsadm" -o restore -url http://mynewsite.com:1234 -filename mysite.com.backup<br /></div><br />where "mynewsite.com:1234" is an existing MOSS site you've crated in the central admin.  You will most likely need to add the switch "-overwrite" to the restore command, unless the new site is completely empty of content.<br /><br /><br /><strong>UPDATE</strong><br /><br />I took a sharepoint designer class last week and learned about a few more deployment options.  Designer does have a few backup and restore tools for WSS/MOSS data: You can create a .fwp <span style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Web Package</span> for publishing a small collection of files (File->Export->Personal web package) or do a site backup (Site->Administration->Backup Website) which creates <span style="font-weight:bold;">Content Migration Package</span> with a .cmp extension.<br /><br />The .cmp is a bit tricky, because it will only restore into the same site tree you backed it up from.  Meaning if you wanted to backup the site "mybackupsite" from the path "/myroot/mysite/mybackupsite" you wont be able to restore that site to the path "/myroot/someoneelsessite/mybackupsite".  The restore utility starts the restore, drops a bunch of files, then errors out with some generic error -.-<br /><br /><strong>YET ANOTHER UPDATE</strong><br /><br />I was trying to use backup/restore to copy a site out from a staging farm to a production farm.  I've had limited success with that.  Sometimes it works without issue.  Sometimes the new site created from the backup generates a sharepoint error on any public page you try to hit. When I run into that error, I dont seem to be able to fix the problem, even when I delete and re-create the web application completely.  I'm now looking into using stsadm -o export to deploy files, I'll create a new post for those results and link to that from here when I'm finished.
