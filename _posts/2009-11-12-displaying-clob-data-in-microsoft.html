I rand into an issue with clob types the other day in MS Report Builder, where when you try to run a report, you get an error about not MS Report Builder not being able to group large string object types.  <br /><br />To work around this error, you need to set the property <i>DiscourageGrouping</i> to "false" on the clob type in the model.  When you redeploy, you'll be able to see the clob data in the report.  A full explanation can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bobmeyers/archive/2006/12/20/getting-grouping-right-in-report-builder.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/bobmeyers/archive/2006/12/20/getting-grouping-right-in-report-builder.aspx</a>
