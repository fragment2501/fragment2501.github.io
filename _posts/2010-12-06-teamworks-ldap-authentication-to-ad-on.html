I just ran into the following error when pointing an existing known good Teamworks 6.2.2 instance from a Windows Server 2003R2 PDC to a Windows Server 2008R2 PDC for domain authentication:<br /><div class="code">LDAP: error code 49 - 80090308<br /></div><br />did some googling and found out that sometimes windows AD requires you to use windows style bind credentials in the format "username@mydomain.com" rather than the traditional ldap DN of the user "CN=username,DC=mydomain,DC=com". Annoying -.-
