So, for those of us stuck using the dreaded renamed frontpage tool, here are a list of links to some of the more common bugs and workarounds:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Sharepoint Desinger becomes out of sync with checkout status (locking checkouts) - <a href="http://robgarrett.com/cs/blogs/software/archive/2007/12/14/sharepoint-designer-and-sharepoint-out-of-sync.aspx">http://robgarrett.com/cs/blogs/software/archive/2007/12/14/sharepoint-designer-and-sharepoint-out-of-sync.aspx</a><br /></li><br /><li>Sharepoint Designer adds &amp;nbsp;'s and other bad formatting when opening a document for edits - <a href="http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2007/02/18/problems-with-sharepoint-designer.aspx">http://blog.thekid.me.uk/archive/2007/02/18/problems-with-sharepoint-designer.aspx</a><br /></li><br /></ul>
