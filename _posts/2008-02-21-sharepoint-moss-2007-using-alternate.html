<div>The default search control granted to you by MOSS cant be modified to look  or act too much differently than what you see in the example default.master  template.  The big problem is the Scope.  For internet sites, its often best to  not show that scope dropdown. Instead, just a simple search box and a go button,  then give the option for the user to refine their search within the search  results page.</div> <div> </div> <div>Looking at alternate templates like BlueBand.master shows that there are  some alternate search WebParts we can use that are much more configurable ...  and they allow us to do away with the anoying scope dropdown.  Lets steal the  BlueBand.master search.  All we need are these two chunks of code: the WebPart  registration call and the call to create an instance of the SearchBox  component:</div><br /><br /><div class="code"><br /><%@ Register Tagprefix="SPSWC"  Namespace="Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal.WebControls"  Assembly="Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal, Version=12.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,  PublicKeyToken=71e9bce111e9429c" %><br /></div><br /><div> </div><br /><div class="code"><br />&lt;div class="search"&gt;<br />&lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder id="PlaceHolderSearchArea" runat="server"&gt;<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Typewriter;"><br />&lt;SPSWC:SearchBoxEx id="SearchBox" RegisterStyles="false" TextBeforeDropDown="" TextBeforeTextBox="&lt;%$Resources:cms,masterpages_searchbox_label%&gt;" TextBoxWidth="100" GoImageUrl="&lt;% $SPUrl:~sitecollection/Style Library/Images/Search_Arrow.jpg %&gt;"<br />           GoImageUrlRTL="&lt;% $SPUrl:~sitecollection/Style Library/Images/Search_Arrow_RTL.jpg %&gt;" UseSiteDefaults="true" DropDownMode = "HideScopeDD" SuppressWebPartChrome="true" runat="server" WebPart="true" __WebPartId="{F8C1236A-6D6E-4EC4-8587-E8D9A1A57F69}"/&gt;<br />&lt;/asp:ContentPlaceHolder&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /></div><br /><div>This control comes with the default installed MOSS templates, so it becomes  a much better option than compiling your own control, then having to maintain it  and worry that a MOSS patch or update might clobber your work.</div><br /><div>As a last thought, though the code works, youre still left with styling the  control to suit your application look and feel ... which is turning out to be  one of the more time consuming parts for me as I"m learning how to develop for  MOSS 2007</div><br /><div>-.- So I'm thinking the next big hurdle for me will be learning the MOSS  method for styling templates.</div>
