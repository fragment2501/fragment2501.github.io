I found a really good article on using SSH public key authentication: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc.html">OpenSSH key management, Part 1</a>.  It covers all the basics on generating user private keys with a passphrase, where to place public keys on the server for authentication, etc.  Just be sure to check your sshd_config file on the target server to make sure youre putting your public keys in the right place.
