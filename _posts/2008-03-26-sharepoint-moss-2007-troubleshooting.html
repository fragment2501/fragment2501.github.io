I've already given a rough overview of how to configure content deployment in MOSS 2007 here<br /><br /><a href="http://bryansgeekspeak.blogspot.com/2008/03/sharepoint-moss-2007-deploying-content.html">http://bryansgeekspeak.blogspot.com/2008/03/sharepoint-moss-2007-deploying-content.html</a><br /><br />and I've also covered the topic of enabling SSL in the central admin here:<br /><br /><a href="http://bryansgeekspeak.blogspot.com/2008/03/sharepoint-moss-2007-deploying-content.html">http://bryansgeekspeak.blogspot.com/2008/03/sharepoint-moss-2007-deploying-content.html</a><br /><br />which gives you the ability to setup content deployment over SSL, so you can securely deploy content from your staging farm to a production farm. <br /><br /><strong>Deployment job hangs on status "Preparing"</strong><br /><br />In my tests, I've run into situations where I setup a path, then a job, but when I run the job the status hangs at the "Preparing" state and nothing ever happens. I'm not sure exactly what causes this issue, but I've managed to get around it doing a combination of the following:<br /><br /><ol><br /><li>Cancel all currently running jobs</li><br /><li>Login ot the "target" server (produciton) and confirm in the Central Admin that the settings in "Operations->Content Deployment Settings" are correct and save them again.</li><br /><li>Check the "Temporary Files" folder set in the "Content Deployment Settings" page. Delete any existing files/folders there. Check the permissions on that folder. It should allow full control to the user described in the source server's central admin application pool (the user account your source server's central admin will use to run the deployment job)</li><br /><li>Delete any existing jobs and paths on the source server, then recreate them. This confirms that you can still hit and authenticate to the central admin of the target server.</li><br /><li>Setup a new job and run a test job. It should return success or failure within minutes. if it takes longer than 10 minutes, cancel the job and recheck everything.</li><br /></ol><br /><br />I'll post more details about this issue when I learn more.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Deployment Failed: The specified name is already in use.</strong><br /><br />Here is the situation:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Site on staging server has data, ready to push to live</li><br /><li>Staging server has a valid configured path and job (can be set to changed data only or all data, same error for both)</li><br /><li>Live server has a web application and a default Site Collection configured (no custom data)</li><br /><li>Live server is peroperly configured to recieve incoming jobs</li><br /></ul><br /><br />When I run the job, I get this error:<br /><br /><div class="code"><br />The specified name is already in use.

Then I'll try deploying any future changes via the Central Admin. Hopefully that will work...I think thats an acceptable work around.
