Needed a place to post my findings on tableless layouts using pure XHTML and CSS.  The basic method I use is here:<br /><br />http://www.moopoint.com/tutorials/css_tableless_layouts.html<br /><br />My thanks to the info and discussion at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html</a> , it helped a lot.  I use the overflow method for all my layouts and I'm always working out bugs/issues.  I'll post them here as I find them.  Here is the first:<br /><br />imitating valign=bottom table behavior:<br /><br />I found this site that suggests using absolute positioning on the "cell" to align it to the bottom of the "row".  The other option they suggest is setting display=table and display=table-cell then using vertical-align on the text....turning divs into tables!  Its madness!<br /><br />http://www.badboy.ro/articles/2005-02-20/index.php
