I just randomly found this site the other day and decided to give this tutorial a try since I really need a good Javascrip/HTML5 refresher ... and wow, the videos are great! (and the instructor is just ... lol)<br />It covers Javascript basics, building/implementing javascript objects, HTML5 canvas, jQuery and a bunch of maths for simple game physics x_x<br /><br />So here you go, a link to the course for building games using pure HTML and Javascript.<br /><br /><a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/beginning-game-development-with-html-5/">http://p2pu.org/en/groups/beginning-game-development-with-html-5/</a>
