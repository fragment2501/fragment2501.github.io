1) Dropbox for free online storage (Your free online 2 gig flash drive!)<br /><br />My friend Phebus got me hooked on Dropbox for all my online storage/file sharing. I just love all the interfaces they give you - The desktop app just creates a folder you can drop files into like a network drive. You can upload entire directory structures if you want (the one at a time file upload from google docs was killing me). No limits on file size or file type, so long as you dont go over your 2 gig storage limit.  Even better, they have an app to access dropbox file on the iphone xD<br /><br />2) DocsToGo for iPhone (works for a bunch of other smart phones too!)<br /><br />Make sure to buy the more expensive premium edition of DocsToGo for the cloud storage feature. From DocsToGo on your smart phone, you can connect to your dropbox account and edit your files directly.  I ran some tests using Word 2007 documents from work, and its pretty amazing. The rendering on the phone is strange, table formatting sometimes shows up strange in the DocsToGo interface, but when I make text changes and save the file back to the cloud, the original format is still in tact when I check from my desktop.  Pretty impressive.<br /><br />T
