<div class="sidenote">Whoops! The link below is broken - I'm trimming down the number of domains I own and moopoint.com was one I let go. I'll bring the code up under the bryansgeekspeak.com domain at some point in the future!</div><br />I added examples for the input types email, tel and url. I also added an example of using a datalist bound to a text input type for suggesting default values. Again, zero javascript validation in these examples - it's all standard HTML5 tags/attributes enforced client side by the browser (tested in FireFox 4).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.moopoint.com/FormsValidation.html">http://www.moopoint.com/FormsValidation.html</a>.
